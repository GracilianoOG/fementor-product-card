# 💻 Product Preview Component | Frontend Mentor

This is my solution for the [Product Preview Card Component Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa) from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home), made with HTML and plain CSS.

It was a very fun and challenging project, I wanted to put BEM in practice by putting the full names of the classes to really fix this metodology in my head.

I had some difficulties but after reading the documentations from **MDN** and **W3Schools** I managed to finish it on my own. Also, since I'm a free user, I didn't get the Figma file so it adds an extra layer of challenge for the completion.
